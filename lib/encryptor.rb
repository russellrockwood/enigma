# You should be able to generate random numbers with leading zeros. In the example shown, the random number was 2715, so it should be zero padded to make it a five digit number (02715)

# Your translation should only translate using lowercase letters. If a letter is uppercase, it should use the lowercase translation, so in the example above, “HELLO WORLD” would still translate to “keder ohulw”

# If you encounter a character not in the character set, it should be translated as itself. Using the example above, “hello world!” should be translated as “keder ohulw!”
