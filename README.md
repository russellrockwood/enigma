## General Information
This solution contains two classes: Enigma and EnigmaCommandLine
- Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods allow user to implement the Caesar Cipher algoritm through IRB.
- EnigmaCommandLine allows you to encrypt/decrypt text files using command line interfaces.
- Enigma and EnigmaCommandLine methods are tested in their corresponding rspec files.

## Installation
Code can be found on Git Hub where it can be cloned to your local machine for further use.

- Ruby
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [SimpleCov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov) SimpleCov is a code coverage analysis tool for Ruby.

## Featured Applications
 - Encrypt and decrypt messages through IRB or Pry session.

## Room for Improvement

The following features can be further expanded upon to increase functionality of the application:
- Improvement to error handling
- Additional class to decipher text without key or date
- Html interface
